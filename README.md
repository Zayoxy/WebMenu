# Purpose
It's a custom local webserver menu that i use for Laragon.

# Setting up
## Steps
1. Clone the project
2. Create a directory called "default" or whatever you want and move the default index file of your server in it.
3. Copy **ALL** the files of the projects in your server WWW directory and delete the clone directory. **DON'T FORGET THE ".git" DIRECTORY**

## .gitignore
The gitignore can ignore everything except some files with "!". Like in programming

Like this, I can commit new changes for the menu without commiting my other web projects.
