# Purpose
It's a custom local webserver menu that i use for Laragon.

# Setting up
## Steps
1. Clone the project
2. Create a directory called "default" or whatever you want and move the default index file of your server in it.
3. Copy the files in it in your server WWW directory and delete the clone directory.

## .gitignore
The gitignore can ignore everything except some files with "!". Like in programming

Like this, I can commit new changes for the menu without commiting my other web projects.
